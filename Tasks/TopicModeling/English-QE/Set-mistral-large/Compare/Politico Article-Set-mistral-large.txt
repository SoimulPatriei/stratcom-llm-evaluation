### Output Guidelines

1. **Topic Assignment:**
   Each relevant topic is assigned a weight from 1 to 5 based on its relevance to the article.

2. **Keyword Identification:**
   Keywords are extracted and weighted according to their relevance and frequency:
   - Score 3: Highly relevant, central keywords that are frequently mentioned.
   - Score 2: Relevant keywords that are important but mentioned less frequently or are less central.
   - Score 1: Keywords that are loosely related or briefly mentioned.

3. **Keyword Length:**
   Keywords are generally shorter than a full sentence but include longer keyword phrases if they are particularly relevant to the topic.

4. **Total Topic Score:**
   The total weight of all keywords is summed to get a total topic score.

5. **Normalized Significance (Out of 10):**
   The total score for each topic is normalized into a scale from 0 to 10 using the formula:
   - Formula: (Total Weight / Maximum Possible Weight) * 10
