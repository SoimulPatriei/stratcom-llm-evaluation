Output Guidelines:

1. Topic Assignment:  
   Assign each relevant topic a weight from 1 to 5:  
   - 1: Minimally relevant  
   - 5: Highly relevant

2. Keyword Identification:  
   For each assigned topic, extract the most relevant n-grams (keyword phrases) from the article. Keywords should be weighted based on their relevance and frequency:  
   - Score 3: Highly relevant, central keywords that are frequently mentioned  
   - Score 2: Relevant keywords that are important but mentioned less frequently or are less central  
   - Score 1: Keywords that are loosely related or briefly mentioned

3. Keyword Length:  
   Keywords should generally be shorter than a full sentence. However, longer keyword phrases can be included if they are particularly relevant.  
   For example:  
   - "no reason to believe the damage has been caused by an explosion"  
   - "Nord Stream I and II gas pipelines from Russia to Germany were damaged by a pair of explosions"

4. Total Topic Score:  
   Add up the weights of all keywords to calculate the total topic score, representing the significance of the topic within the article.

5. Normalized Significance (Out of 10):  
   Normalize the total score for each topic onto a scale from 0 to 10 for easier comparison:  
   - Formula: (Total Weight / Maximum Possible Weight) × 10
