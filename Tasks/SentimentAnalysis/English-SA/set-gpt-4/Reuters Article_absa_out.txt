## Conclusion:
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) provides a nuanced understanding of the geopolitical situation in news articles about hostile situations. It not only identifies the key entities involved but also provides insight into the specific aspects related to these entities and the sentiments associated with them. For instance, in this analysis, we identified the entities such as the Kremlin, the Baltic Sea, the Latvian President, and the damage to the Balticconnector pipeline, among others. The ABSA approach allowed us to understand the various aspects related to these entities, such as political influence, economic impact, communication, security, and investigation. We also obtained insights into sentiments associated with these aspects, which ranged from negative to neutral. This detailed analysis helps to paint a comprehensive picture of the situation, going beyond simple entity recognition to understand the complex interplay of factors in the geopolitical scenario. As such, ABSA is a valuable tool in the analysis of international relations, specifically in the context of hostile situations.
