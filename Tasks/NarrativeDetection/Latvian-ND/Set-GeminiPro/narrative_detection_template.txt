Perform narrative detection on the article provided. The text is in a language specified as input.

1. Named Entity Recognition:
   - Identify entities such as actors, events, locations, and timelines that provide significant semantic insights into the narrative.
   - The tags for the entities should be in English.
   - The entities themselves should be in the language of the article.
   - Assign a score to each entity found, reflecting its importance in the document.
   - The entities should be ordered by their importance scores from highest to lowest.
   - The total of all scores assigned to the entities should sum to one.
   - Examples:
{ner_examples}

2. Relationship Extraction:
   - Extract binary semantic relationships between the entities identified in the Named Entity Recognition layer.
   - The names of the relationships should be in English.
   - The entities involved in the relationships should be in the language of the article.
   - Examples:
{re_examples}

3. Plot Discovery:
   - Identify the main components of the plot using Freytag's Pyramid, which includes the following stages:
     - Exposition
     - Rising Action
     - Climax
     - Falling Action
     - Resolution
   - Whenever possible, use entities identified in the Named Entity Recognition layer to describe the plot components.
   - The stage names should be in English.
   - The content within each stage should be in the language of the article.
   - Examples:
{plot_examples}

4. Story Evolution:
   - This layer should include two components:
     - Shift Detection: Recognize significant changes or deviations in the narrative.
     - Causal Relation Extraction: Identify the reasons behind each significant event or decision in the story.
   - Whenever possible, use entities identified in the Named Entity Recognition layer for these components.
   - Examples:
