**3. Plot Discovery:**

**Exposition:**

* The Kremlin denies any involvement in the damage to the Balticconnector pipeline and a telecoms cable.
* Finnish investigators are investigating the damage, which may have been an act of sabotage.
* Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics has threatened to close the Baltic Sea to shipping if Russia is found responsible for the damage.

**Rising Action:**

* Peskov asks Rinkevics about the explosions of Nord Stream gas pipelines, which Moscow blames on the United States and its allies.

**Climax:**

* Peskov criticizes Rinkevics for remaining silent about the Nord Stream explosions.

**Falling Action:**

* The article concludes without a clear resolution to the situation.

**Shift Detection:**

* The narrative shifts when the Kremlin warns against threats to Russia and criticizes Rinkevics for his silence about the Nord Stream explosions.

**Causal Relation Extraction:**

* The Kremlin's warning against threats is likely a response to Rinkevics' threat to close the Baltic Sea to shipping.
* Peskov's criticism of Rinkevics is likely due to his belief that the United States and its allies are responsible for the Nord Stream explosions.
