### Relationship Extraction

**Layer Output:**

- is damaged [Baltic-connector pipeline, external activity]
- is investigated [damage to Baltic-connector pipeline, Finland and Estonia]
- is suspected [sabotage, Russian involvement]
- is detected [probable explosion, Norsar]
- is ruled out [seismic activity, Finnish authorities]
- is supported [Finland and Estonia, NATO]
- is expected [repair, months]
- is affected [European gas prices, suspected sabotage]
- is closed [Israel's Tamar gas field, Hamas aggression]
- is halted [Russian imports, May last year]

### Plot Discovery

**Layer Output:**

**Exposition:**
Finland and Estonia discover damage to the Baltic-connector pipeline, which is suspected to be deliberate and caused by external activity.

**Rising Action:**
The pipeline is shut down after a sudden drop in pressure, and a telecoms cable is also damaged. Finnish authorities and the BBC report suspicions of Russian sabotage as retribution for Finland joining NATO.

**Climax:**
Norsar detects a probable explosion along Finland's Baltic Sea coast, contradicting initial statements from Finland's National Bureau of Investigation (KRP) that there were no indications of explosives.

**Falling Action:**
Finnish authorities confirm that the damage could not have been caused by normal use or pressure fluctuations. NATO expresses support for Finland and Estonia, and European gas prices rise in response to the suspected sabotage.

**Resolution:**
Finland's prime minister, Petteri Orpo, assures that there are enough alternative sources of gas to ensure the country's energy security. The damage to the pipeline revives concerns about energy security following the Nord Stream pipeline blasts last year.

### Story Evolution

**Layer Output:**

**Shift Detection:**
A significant change occurs in the narrative when Norsar detects a probable explosion, contradicting the initial statements from Finland's National Bureau of Investigation (KRP).

**Causal Relation Extraction:**
The detection of a probable explosion by Norsar is in response to the damage to the Baltic-connector pipeline, which was initially suspected to be caused by external activity, possibly Russian sabotage. This detection heightens concerns about energy security and leads to a rise in European gas prices.
