### Plot Discovery

**Freytag's Pyramid:**

**Exposition:**
Finland and Estonia share a gas pipeline, the Baltic Connector, which also carries telecoms links. Engineers noticed a drop in pressure in the early hours of Sunday morning and decided to cut off the flow of gas.

**Rising Action:**
The pipeline was closed on Sunday after a leak was discovered. Finland's president, Sauli Niinistö, stated that the damage was likely caused by external activity.

**Climax:**
The leak in the pipeline led to a significant disruption in gas supply and telecommunications between Finland and Estonia. Investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of the leak.

**Falling Action:**
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg shared information with allies about the damage to the Baltic Connector pipeline. Gasgrid Finland and Estonia's Elering are investigating the incident together.

**Resolution:**
Repairing the damage to the pipeline could take at least several months, depending on the nature of the damage. The investigation continues to determine the specific cause of the leak.

### Story Evolution

**Shift Detection:**
A significant change occurs in the narrative when Finland's president, Sauli Niinistö, suggests that the damage to the Baltic Connector pipeline was likely caused by external activity.

**Causal Relation Extraction:**
The suggestion by Finland's president that the damage was caused by external activity is made in response to the investigation findings, which indicate that the leak was not due to internal factors. This shifts the focus of the investigation towards potential sabotage or external interference.
