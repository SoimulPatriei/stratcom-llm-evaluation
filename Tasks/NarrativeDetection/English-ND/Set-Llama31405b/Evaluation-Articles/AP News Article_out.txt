**Plot Discovery:**

Exposition: The Balticconnector pipeline, a crucial link between the Nordic and Baltic gas markets, was damaged in October last year, causing a major drop in pressure.

Rising Action: The investigation into the pipeline damage has been ongoing, with the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation suspecting the Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear of causing the damage.

Climax: The investigation has progressed, and cooperation with Chinese authorities has been established, but the question of who will pay for the repairs remains open.

Falling Action: The pipeline has been reopened after multimillion-euro repair work, and NATO has stepped up its patrols of the Baltic Sea to secure the area and detect suspicious movement near its critical undersea infrastructure.

Resolution: The incident has highlighted the importance of securing critical undersea infrastructure and the need for cooperation between nations to address such incidents.

**Story Evolution:**

Shift Detection: A significant change occurs in the narrative when the Finnish authorities reveal that they believe the Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear caused the damage to the pipeline.

Causal Relation Extraction: The damage to the pipeline was caused by the dislodged anchor of the Newnew Polar Bear, which was on its way to St. Petersburg, Russia. The incident highlights the importance of securing critical undersea infrastructure and the need for cooperation between nations to address such incidents. The Finnish authorities' failure to establish radio contact with the captain of the Newnew Polar Bear despite several attempts also contributed to the incident.
