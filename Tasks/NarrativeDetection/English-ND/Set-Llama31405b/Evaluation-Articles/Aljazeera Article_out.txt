Exposition: A gas pipeline and a telecoms cable between Finland and Estonia are damaged in a suspected sabotage incident on October 8.

Rising Action: Finnish investigators begin to investigate the incident, focusing on the potential role of a Chinese ship, the NewNew Polar Bear container vessel. China denies any involvement and calls for an objective investigation.

Climax: The investigation confirms that the damage was caused by an external mechanical force, and NATO increases patrols in the Baltic Sea due to concerns about energy security.

Falling Action: The incident prompts concerns about the security of energy supplies in the wider Nordic region, and officials in the Baltic region remain suspicious regarding Moscow's involvement.

Resolution: The investigation continues, with China and Finland communicating over the damage, and NATO maintaining increased patrols in the Baltic Sea.
