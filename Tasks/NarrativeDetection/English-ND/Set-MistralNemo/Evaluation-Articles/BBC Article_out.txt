**2. Relationship Extraction:**

- Finland's prime minister (Petteri Orpo) said [damage to Baltic-connector pipeline was probably caused by "external activity"]
- Norway's seismological institute, Norsar, detected [probable explosion] along Finland's Baltic Sea coast
- Damage to the cable and pipeline [happened at two different spots] in Finland's Exclusive Economic Zone
- The pipeline is Finland's [only direct link to the wider European Union's gas network]
- Jens Stoltenberg (NATO) [stands ready to support Allies concerned]
- The prospect that the damage could be deliberate [pushed up European gas prices]
- The damage to the Baltic-connector pipeline [revived concerns about energy security] following the Nord Stream pipeline blasts

**3. Plot Discovery:**

*Exposition:* Finland's Baltic-connector pipeline with Estonia suffered damage, with a sudden drop in pressure and a telecoms cable also damaged.
*Rising Action:* Finland investigates the cause, which may have been deliberate and due to external activity.
*Climax:* Norway's seismological institute detects a probable explosion, contradicting earlier statements.
*Falling Action:* Finland and Estonia investigate the cause together, and NATO offers support.
*Resolution:* No clear cause is found yet, but the pipeline's damage is expected to take months to repair.

**4. Story Evolution:**

*Shift Detection:* The narrative changes when Norway's seismological institute detects a probable explosion, contradicting earlier statements from Finnish authorities.
*Causal Relation Extraction:* The explosion was likely the cause of the damage to the pipeline, leading to investigations and concerns about energy security.
