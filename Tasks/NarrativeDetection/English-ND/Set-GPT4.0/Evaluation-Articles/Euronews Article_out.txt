3. Plot Discovery:
Layer Output:
Exposition: Engineers noticed a drop in pressure in the Baltic Connector pipeline and decided to cut off the gas flow.
Rising Action: The pipeline, which supplies Finland with gas from Estonia, was shut due to an apparent leak, with suspicions of external activity causing the damage.
Climax: Finnish authorities, in collaboration with their Estonian counterparts, launch an investigation into the cause of the leak.
Falling Action: The NATO Secretary General shares information with allies about the damage and possible external sabotage.
Resolution: Repairs on the pipeline are ongoing, which could take several months.

4. Story Evolution:
Layer Output:
Shift Detection: A significant narrative change occurs when the possibility of external activity causing the damage to the pipeline is revealed.
Causal Relation Extraction: The drop in pipeline pressure and subsequent shutdown of the gas flow was a direct result of the suspected leak, which is currently under investigation for potential external sabotage.
