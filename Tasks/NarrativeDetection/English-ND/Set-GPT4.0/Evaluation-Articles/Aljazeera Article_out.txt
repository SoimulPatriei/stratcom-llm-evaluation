2. Relationship Extraction:
Layer Output:
is investigating [Finland, suspected sabotage of a subsea gas pipeline]
begun communication over [China and Finland, the damage to the Balticconector gas pipeline]
is focused on [Helsinki's investigation, the potential role of a Chinese ship]
was studying [NBI, how the NewNew Polar Bear container vessel]
contacted [Tallinn, Beijing]
rejected [Mao Ning, any suggestion that China was responsible]
found [NBI, a "heavy object" near the pipeline damage]
increased [NATO, patrols in the Baltic Sea]
invaded [Russia, Ukraine]
looking into [Estonian investigators, two ships concerning the incident]
said [Rosatom, its ship had no link to the pipeline damage]
remain suspicious [officials in the Baltic region, Moscow]
said [Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, threats made towards Russia were unacceptable]
