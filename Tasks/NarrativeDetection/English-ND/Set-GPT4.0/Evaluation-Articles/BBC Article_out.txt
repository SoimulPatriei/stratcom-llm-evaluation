2. Relationship Extraction:
- investigates [Finland, suspected sabotage of Baltic-connector gas pipeline]
- was shut down [Baltic-connector pipeline, after a sudden drop in pressure]
- added [Petteri Orpo, that the cause was not yet clear]
- detected [Norsar, a "probable explosion"]
- contradicts [statement from Finland's National Bureau of Investigation (KRP), Norway's seismological institute, Norsar]
- said [Finnish authorities, damage to the cable and pipeline damage happened at two different spots in Finland's Exclusive Economic Zone]
- told a press conference [Mr Orpo, "The discovered damage could not have been caused by normal use of the pipeline or pressure fluctuations"]
- writes [Jens Stoltenberg, on X (formerly Twitter) that the bloc was "sharing information & stands ready to support Allies concerned"]
- closes [Israel, one of its largest gas fields, Tamar]

3. Plot Discovery:
Exposition: Finland detects damage to the Baltic-connector gas pipeline with Estonia and suspects it may have been caused by "external activity".
Rising Action: The prime minister of Finland, Petteri Orpo, announces that the source of the leak has been found and is being investigated. Meanwhile, suspicions of Russian sabotage arise.
Climax: Norway's seismological institute, Norsar, detects a "probable explosion" along Finland's Baltic Sea coast, contradicting Finland's National Bureau of Investigation (KRP) statement. 
Falling Action: The damage to the pipeline is expected to take months to repair, causing a rise in European gas prices. Meanwhile, Finland assures that the country's energy security is not at risk.
Resolution: Despite the damage to the pipeline, Finland continues to ensure its energy security through alternative sources of gas. The incident revives concerns about energy security.

4. Story Evolution:
Shift Detection: A significant shift in the narrative occurs when Norway's seismological institute, Norsar, detects a "probable explosion", contradicting Finland's National Bureau of Investigation's statement.
Causal Relation Extraction: The rise in European gas prices is a direct result of the damaging of the Baltic-connector pipeline and the subsequent closing of Israel's Tamar gas field. The suspected sabotage of the pipeline is believed to be "retribution" for Finland joining NATO.
