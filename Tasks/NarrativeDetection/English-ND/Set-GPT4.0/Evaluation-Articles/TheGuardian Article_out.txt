2. Relationship Extraction:
   - recovered from [large ship’s anchor, spot where Baltic Sea gas pipeline was damaged]
   - seeking to establish [Finnish investigators, whether anchor came from a Chinese container vessel]
   - said on [Finland’s central criminal police (KRP), Tuesday]
   - lifted from [anchor, the seabed]
   - focused on [National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Hong Kong-flagged, Chinese-owned NewNew Polar Bear]
   - missing [container ship, a front anchor]
   - coincided with [movements of vessel, the pipeline damage]
   - confirmed [Helsinki, the damage to the Balticconnector gas pipeline]
   - shut down [operators, the pipeline]
   - caused by [damage, “an external force”]
   - joined [Finland, Nato]
   - pledged [transatlantic alliance, a “united and determined response”]
   - take [it will, at least five months to repair the pipeline]
   - relies on [Finland, gas for about 5% of its energy supplies]
   - said [Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, damage to a second telecommunications cable was “purposeful”]
   - found [Swedish navy, tracks on the seabed]
   - said [Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, alliance members had “tens of thousands of kilometres” of submarine internet cables, power cables, gas pipelines and oil pipelines]

3. Plot Discovery:
   - Exposition: Finnish investigators recover a large ship’s anchor from near the spot where a Baltic Sea gas pipeline was damaged.
   - Rising Action: The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) focuses on a Hong Kong-flagged, Chinese-owned vessel, the NewNew Polar Bear, which is missing a front anchor.
   - Climax: The NBI begins to suspect that the pipeline damage may have been deliberate, and the state security intelligence service does not rule out state involvement.
   - Falling Action: Following the damage to the pipeline, Balticconnector's operators estimate that it will take at least five months for repairs to complete.
   - Resolution: Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, highlights the vulnerability of undersea critical infrastructure and announces that NATO is working with the private sector to protect these structures.

4. Story Evolution:
   - Shift Detection: A significant shift in the narrative occurs when the NBI begins to suspect that the pipeline damage may have been deliberate.
   - Causal Relation Extraction: The recovery of the large ship's anchor near the damaged pipeline leads Finnish investigators to suspect a Chinese vessel, the NewNew Polar Bear, which is found to be missing a front anchor.
