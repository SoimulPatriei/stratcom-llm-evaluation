Climax: Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, calls the threats against Russia unacceptable and demands an explanation for the explosions on Russia's Nord Stream gas pipelines in the previous year.
Falling Action: The United States, who Russia blames for the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosions, denies responsibility. Meanwhile, Finnish investigators focus on the role of the Chinese NewNew Polar Bear container vessel in the Balticconnector pipeline incident.
