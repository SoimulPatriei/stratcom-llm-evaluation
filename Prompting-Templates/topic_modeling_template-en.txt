Output Guidelines:

1. Topic Assignment:  
   Assign each relevant topic a weight from 1 to 5:
   - 1: Minimally relevant  
   - 5: Highly relevant

2.     Keyword Identification:
    For each assigned topic, extract the most relevant n-grams (keyword phrases) from the article. These keywords should be weighted according to their relevance and frequency:
        Score 3: Highly relevant, central keywords that are frequently mentioned.
        Score 2: Relevant keywords that are important but mentioned less frequently or are less central.
        Score 1: Keywords that are loosely related or briefly mentioned.

3.     Keyword Length:
       Keywords should generally be shorter than a full sentence. However, do not hesitate to include longer keyword phrases if they are particularly relevant to the topic.
        For example: "no reason to believe the damage has been caused by an explosion" or "Nord Stream I and II gas pipelines from Russia to Germany were damaged by a pair of explosions"

4. Total Topic Score:  
   Add up the weights of all keywords to get a total topic score, representing the significance of the topic within the article.

5. Normalized Significance (Out of 10):  
   Normalize the total score for each topic into a scale from 0 to 10 for easier comparison:
   - Formula: (Total Weight / Maximum Possible Weight) * 10
